While my bud was playing around with his Vampiric Amiga, I took a moment to install a new motherboard and CPU in the Arcade machine. Next up will be replacing the screen and finally we need to replace the sticks with something more decent (and 2 of the same ones would also be nice). For now, only internals got upgraded.
