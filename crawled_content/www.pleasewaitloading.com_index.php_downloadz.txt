One of the greatest games ever created. Way ahead of it's time in the way it implemented things like day and night cycles, diseases like scurvy if you don't eat vegetables for a long time, invisible karma points being tracked etc etc. 7 parts were planned, only 2 were released. This is the PC port of the first part 'The City'. The original open world procedurally generated RPG ! Very hard to play on modern PCs, even with DosBox, there is also a Unity remake out there.Â  The Atari 800 version is known to be the best one out there. All other versions are ports. It did have some limitations though, you cannot get a job that feature is only in the 16-bit versions of the game. Amazing platformer with so many secrets. Wanna be Indiana Jones ? Spin this one up :) Text based adventure. James Bond without the James Bond name
