Corona couldn't stop us from getting together to install this awesome accelerator board into my buds Amiga 500. He waited over a year to finally get this thing. Installation of the board itself was quite simple, but getting the most out of it with software is another adventure on its own. We ran CoffinOS on it, and even managed to get it connected to the internet =) The browser in CoffinOS does not load complex pages. It actually barely loads anything other than plain HTML, but it was still a lot of fun to play around with this and see an Amiga 500 browsing the web in 2020.
