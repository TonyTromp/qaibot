## QAIBOT Discord Bot powered by OpenAI

This is a Discord bot with AI features, powered by GPT4.

Qaibot supports the following commands:

/qai, Ask QAI any question... answered using GPT4.
/joinconvo, Let QAI join the conversation (reads last 15 messages).
/summarize, QAI will summarize the content of a given URL.
/imback, I was away for a while, what happened while I was gone? Summarize the last 200 messages.
/pricewatch, Search for component prices on Tweakers Pricewatch.
/research, Let QAI research a topic on the web for you.

Research is probably the coolest option. It searches the web, summarizes websites and uses them as context to answer the research question.
